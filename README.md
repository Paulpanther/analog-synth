# analog-synth

I'm building my own modular synth following https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/mki-x-esedu-diy-system/.
The files in this repo where exported by EasyEDA. 

Progress:
- [X] VCO from kit
- [ ] PSU: schematic is ready, but not yet tested
- [ ] MIDI to CV: components are there, but no schematics yet
